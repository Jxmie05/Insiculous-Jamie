			<h2>Ambivalence</h2>
			<p>Hey there, it's me again! I wanna tell you a little bit about my song "Ambivalence". It's a deep one, ya know? It's about this feeling that I can't quite put my finger on - it's like a mix of hope and fear, joy and pain, all wrapped up in one confusing package.

The song starts off with me trying to figure out what this feeling is, and wondering if it's a sign of things to come. But as it goes on, I start to realize that I'm the one in control of my own future - it's up to me to decide if I'm gonna let my ambivalence take over, or if I'm gonna take charge and make things happen.

I think we've all been there, you know? Wondering if we're headed towards something good or bad, feeling like we're stuck in some kind of enclosure. But the thing is, we don't have to stay there. We can choose to break free, to reclaim our happiness, and to reframe our future. And that's what "Ambivalence" is all about - taking control of our own lives, no matter how confusing or scary it might feel.</p>
