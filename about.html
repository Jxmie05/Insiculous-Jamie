			<h2>About Jamie</h2>
			<p>Hi there, I'm Jamie, a 2000's kid with an insatiable passion for rock music. From a young age, I was surrounded by music, which undoubtedly played a significant role in shaping my musical mind. When I was 15, I picked up a bass guitar and fell in love with it. Since then, I've been hooked and have never looked back.

My biggest musical influences are the legendary Flea from Red Hot Chili Peppers, Geddy Lee from Rush, and John Paul Jones from Led Zeppelin. Their incredible talent and unique style have always inspired me to strive for excellence and constantly push my limits.

After finishing high school, I decided to pursue my passion for music and enrolled in the NC Music program at West Highland College in Fort William. It was an essential experience for me, as I made new friends, performed live for the first time, and learned how to play with other people. The knowledge and skills I gained during my time there have been invaluable to my growth as a musician.

Playing bass and creating music is not just a hobby for me; it's a way of life. I pour my heart and soul into every note I play, and I hope to one day make a name for myself in the music industry. I'm excited to see where my musical journey takes me and can't wait to share my love for rock music with the world.</p>
