			<h2>Miffed</h2>
			<p>So "Miffed" is a song that's really close to my heart. It's all about that one person in your life who just keeps bringing you down, no matter how hard you try to cut ties. I wanted to capture that frustration and anger in the lyrics, and I think I did a pretty good job with it.

The first verse is all about trying to distance yourself from this person, but feeling like you can never fully get away. And the bridge is just a big "screw you" to that person, because they think they're so clever, but really they're just making you "bloody miffed." I love that phrase, it's just so raw and honest.

The chorus is probably my favorite part of the song. It's this big, anthemic moment where you can just scream out your frustrations and feel like you're not alone. And the middle 8 just drives it home with a repeated chant of "I'm bloody miffed!" It's such a cathartic moment.

The last verse is all about realizing that this person doesn't want you to succeed, and that's just a really hard pill to swallow. But I think it's important to acknowledge that, and to find a way to move forward despite it. And of course, we had to bring back the bridge to really hammer home our frustration and anger.

Overall, I'm really proud of "Miffed." It's a song that's so personal to me, but I think it's also something that a lot of people can relate to. The lyrics are honest and raw, and the driving beat just makes you want to scream along. I hope that when people listen to it, they feel like they're not alone in their frustrations.</p>
